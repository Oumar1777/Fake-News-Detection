Discovering Fake News using ML and Python

Do you trust all the news you hear from social media?
How will you detect fake news?
To make a difference between real and fake news, detect fake news from the attached dataset.

Dataset description:
The dataset we’ll use for this python project- we’ll call it somenews.csv. This dataset has a shape of 7796×4. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE.


This challenge is designed to evaluate a few things, with roughly the priority below:

your clarity in documenting and justifying your approach,
your ability to craft clear, readable code,
your choice of algorithms.

Please send me back a zip file that contains your implementation files (exclude the dataset).
