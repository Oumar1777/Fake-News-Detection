      "Original Text :\n",
      "Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \n",
      "In the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \n",
      "The word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \n",
      "But that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \n",
      "The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \n",
      "The FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \n",
      "The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \n",
      "The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \n",
      "James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \n",
      "Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \n",
      "Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \n",
      "If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \n",
      "Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \n",
      "Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \n",
      "The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \n",
      "And it’s an interesting question. \n",
      "Hillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \n",
      "Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \n",
      "There are two possible explanations. \n",
      "Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \n",
      "But the other explanation is that her people panicked. \n",
      "Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \n",
      "During the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \n",

      "daniel greenfield  a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center  is a new york writer focusing on radical islam   in the final stretch of the election  hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi   the word  unprecedented  has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired  but it s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi   but that s exactly what hillary and her people have done  coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillary s opponent in this election   the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn  hillary s people have circulated a letter attacking comey  there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump  it wouldn t be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi   the fbi s leadership is being warned that the entire left wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary  and the fbi s credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton   the covert struggle between fbi agents and obama s doj people has gone explosively public   the new york times has compared comey to j  edgar hoover  its bizarre headline   james comey role recalls hoover s fbi  fairly or not  practically admits up front that it s spouting nonsense  the boston globe has published a column calling for comey s resignation  not to be outdone  time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women   james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane  he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb  and you thought the  vast right wing conspiracy  was a stretch   countless media stories charge comey with violating procedure  do you know what s a procedural violation  emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server   senator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act  the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment  but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever   if james comey is really out to hurt hillary  he picked one hell of a strange way to do it   not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement  if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going  why did he trash the investigation  was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiner s computer   either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or he s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillary s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs   the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency  most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a   unfavorable rating   and it s an interesting question   hillary s old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway  instead her associates insisted that it was a security review  the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off  but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi   pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy  but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb   there are two possible explanations   hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near  the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign   but the other explanation is that her people panicked   going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign  it s an act of desperation  when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi  that s not hubris  it s fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her   during the original fbi investigation  hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out  and she had good reason for believing that  but that hillary clinton is gone  in her place is a paranoid wreck  within a short space of time the  positive  clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi   there s only one reason for such bizarre behavior   the clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival  and so it s gone all in on fighting the fbi  it s an unprecedented step born of fear  it s hard to know whether that fear is justified  but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot   clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation  they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions  now suddenly they are no longer in control  and they are afraid   you can smell the fear   the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation  it s finding new emails all the time  and clintonworld panicked  the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire  all that s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance  but this isn t how you react to smoke  it s how you respond to a

      "geneva  reuters    north korea and the united states clashed at a u n  forum on tuesday over their military intentions towards one another  with pyongyang s envoy declaring it would  never  put its nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table  japan  well within reach of north korea s missiles  said the world must maintain pressure on the reclusive country to rein in its nuclear and missile programs and now was not the time for a resumption of multi party talks  north korea has pursued its weapons programs in defiance of u n  security council sanctions and ignored all calls  including from major ally china  to stop  prompting a bellicose exchange of rhetoric between the north and the united states  north korea justifies its weapons programs  including its recent threat to fire missiles towards the u s  pacific territory of guam  by pointing to perceived u s  hostility  such as military exercises with south korea this week  u s  disarmament ambassador robert wood told a u n  sponsored conference on disarmament in geneva u s  president donald trump s top priority was to protect the united states and its allies against the  growing threat  from north korea and america was ready to use  the full range of capabilities  at its disposal  the  path to dialogue still remained an option  for pyongyang and it had the choice between poverty and belligerence on the one hand and prosperity and acceptance  north korea s envoy told the same forum the north s nuclear deterrent would never be up for negotiation  echoing pyongyang s regular denunciation of u s   aggression    the measures taken by the dprk to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self defense in the face of such apparent and real threats   diplomat ju yong chol told the forum  referring to  constant nuclear threats  by the united states  dprk stands for the north s official name  the democratic people s republic of korea  regarding joint u s  south korean military exercises that began on monday  he warned   the ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire  driving the current tense situation to further deterioration   japanese foreign minister taro kono said pressure must be maintained until the north demonstrated it would give up its nuclear program   it s not the time to discuss  the resumption of  six party talks   kono said  referring to stalled negotiations involving both koreas  the united states  russia  china and japan   it s time to exert pressure   he told reporters  the head of the u s  military s pacific command said diplomacy was key  admiral harry harris was in south korea to observe annual joint military drills with the south korean military  which the north called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by  war maniacs    so we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by kim jong un   harris told reporters at a u s  air base in osan  about an hour from seoul  referring to the north korean leader  he said diplomacy was  the most important starting point  in response to the north s threat  when asked what actions by north korea might trigger a preemptive u s  strike against it   as far as a timeline  it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance  if we did that  it would hardly be a military strategy   he said  the united states and south korea began the long planned exercises on monday  called the ulchi freedom guardian  which the allies have said are purely defensive  the drills involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear capable north korea  the united states and south korea are technically still at war with the north because their   conflict ended in a truce  not a peace treaty   delegations from about  countries spoke at the four hour u n  session  including britain  france  australia and south korea  all of which criticized north korea   i would like to repeat the appeal to the dprk to listen to the fact that there is no alternative to stopping the different provocations and to return to dialogue   south korean ambassador kim inchul said   we have never threatened the dprk with any attacks and we have never promoted the use of force   \n"
